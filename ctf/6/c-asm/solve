1 sort
2 min of 2
3 gcd
4 linear search
5 is even switch



c4 and asm2 have same moves
asm2 looks like search: loop and jump when equal
am3 jumps only forward => no cycles => min, it also selects number from stack and compares the,
asm4 has 1 loop and idiv, is it gcd????
asm5 has no loops and 4 jumps with assign with 0/1 and shr
